George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is the 43rd and current President of the United States, inaugurated on January 20, 2001 and re-elected in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. He was the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. Bush's family has a significant history of involvement in the Republican Party and US politics – Bush is the eldest son of the 41st U.S. President, George H. W. Bush, grandson to Prescott Bush, the former U.S. Senator from Connecticut, and older brother to Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida.
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, George W. Bush responded by declaring a global War on Terrorism. In early October 2001 he ordered the invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and destroy al-Qaeda.[1] In March 2003, Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN Resolution 1441 regarding weapons of mass destruction and had to be disarmed by force.[2] Following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, Bush committed the U.S. to establishing democracy in the Middle East, starting with Afghanistan and Iraq.[3]
Bush was first elected in 2000, becoming the fourth president in U.S. history to be elected without a plurality of the popular vote after the 1824, 1876 and 1888 elections. As a self-described war president,[4] he won re-election in 2004[5] after an intense and heated election campaign in which his prosecution of the War on Terror and the Iraq war were made the central issues, becoming the first candidate to win a majority popular vote since his father did so 16 years earlier.[6] In the previous three elections, strong showings by third-party candidates prevented anyone from winning a popular majority.

Since his re-election, he has received increasingly heated criticism, even from former allies, on the Iraq War, Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandals, as well as domestic issues such as federal funding of stem cell research, Hurricane Katrina, and controversies such as NSA warrantless surveillance activities and the Plame affair. According to polls of job approval rating, his popularity reached record heights after the September 11, 2001 attacks, but declined significantly since then, due to his perceived poor handling of the Iraq War, according to polls.[8] It was one of the major reasons for what Bush called the "thumpin'" of the Republican Party in November 2006 mid-term elections.[9]
